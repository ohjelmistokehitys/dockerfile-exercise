# Containerizing web applications with Docker

This exercise will guide you through the process of containerizing a web application using Docker. You will learn how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a container from that image.

We assume that you have completed previous exercises in this course and are familiar with basic concepts of Docker. This exercise itself is *not a tutorial*, but an exercise, where you are expected to apply the knowledge from other tutorials and documentation. You need to do your own research and read the documentation to complete the tasks. Discussing the tasks with your peers and instructors is highly encouraged.

The [Docker workshop (docker.com)](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/) provides a good introduction to Dockerfiles and how to use them. The blog post [How to Dockerize a React App(Docker.com)](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/) provides a very similar example, but for a React application. Although the technologies are different, the concepts and instructions are very similar, so you can apply the knowledge from that post to this exercise as well.


## Sanuli

The application to be containerized this exercise is Sanuli, *"A finnish version of a popular word guessing game implemented in Rust."* [(Sanuli at GitHub)](https://github.com/Cadiac/sanuli) You can play the game online at [sanuli.fi](https://sanuli.fi/).

Although the game is [written in Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), **you do not need to know Rust nor install any Rust tools in your host system**. Instead, you will use [a Docker base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) that contains the necessary tools to build and run the application.


## The Sanuli *submodule*

Sanuli has its own [Git repository](https://github.com/Cadiac/sanuli), which we have included as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in this repository. This allows you to easily access the Sanuli code without needing to clone it separately. Initially after you have cloned this repository, the submodule [/sanuli](./sanuli) will be empty. To populate it with the code from the upstream Sanuli repository, you need to initialize and update the submodule in the root of your repository. You can do this by running the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git submodule init      # initialize the submodule
git submodule update    # fetch the latest code from the submodule repository
```

**You will not need to make any changes in the Sanuli code**. Reading the [Sanuli readme file](./sanuli/README.md) is enough to understand how to build and run the application. There are also instructions on how to prepare the word lists that the game uses, which we will cover later in the exercise.

If you want to learn more about Git submodules, we recommend watching the video [Git Submodules Tutorial (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/gSlXo2iLBro?si=Q_srt86bHf767323) or reading the [Git documentation on submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). However, the two commands above are all you need in this exercise.


## Side quest: Creating a sandbox

In DevOps, automation is often seen as the ultimate goal - a way to streamline processes, reduce errors, and accelerate delivery. But it can be difficult and daunting to start with automating a task, if you don't understand it or haven't done it manually first.

Executing tasks manually may reveal nuances, edge cases, and unexpected requirements that would be more difficult to discover if trying to achieve full automation right away. This is especially true for complex tasks, such as the one we are about to tackle in this exercise. Even though the exercise aims to create a Dockerfile, you may want to start by creating a simple Docker container with a plain base image first. We could call this a "sandbox", where you can experiment with all the commands and steps. To create such a sandbox, you can use the [Rust base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) and run a container from it. This will give you a minimal environment with the necessary tools to build and run the Sanuli application. You can also copy the Sanuli source code into the container manually, and follow the quick start instructions from the [Sanuli readme file](./sanuli/README.md) to get the application running.

```bash
# Create an interacative container with the latest default Rust image.
# Add a port mapping and a name, but do not start it yet (create instead of run):
docker create -it --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 --name sanuli-sandbox rust:latest

# Copy the Sanuli source code into the container:
docker cp sanuli sanuli-sandbox:/sanuli

# Start the container (this will run the container in the background):
docker start sanuli-sandbox

# Attach to the container's terminal to interact with it:
docker attach sanuli-sandbox
```

The previous steps should end up with a terminal in the container, where you can run commands as if you were in a regular Linux environment. The Sanuli source code should now be available in the `/sanuli` directory inside the container:

```bash
# In the container terminal, change to the Sanuli directory:
cd /sanuli

# List the copied files:
ls -la

# Read the readme for further quick start instructions:
cat README.md
```

Now, you can try to get the Sanuli application running manually, without worrying about the Dockerfile yet. This way, you can familiarize yourself with the application and its requirements, and then apply that knowledge to create a Dockerfile that automates the process of building and running the application.


## Step 1: Creating the Dockerfile

This repository contains a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) that you will use to build the Docker image for Sanuli. As you already know, a Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.

Docker images are the executable packages that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Images are based on base images, which provide the operating system and other necessary components. In this exercise, we recommend using the official [Rust base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) as the base image.

The [Sanuli readme file](./sanuli/README.md) contains all the commands needed to build and run the application. The tools, which come pre-installed in the Rust base image, are:

* [`rustup` for toolchain management](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* [`cargo` for package management](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
* Sanuli also uses the [`trunk` web application bundler](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk), which is installed with `cargo`.

Note that you don't need to install Rust or any of these tools, as the base image already contains them. However, the repository does not contain word lists, which we will cover later in the exercise.

To complete this part of the exercise, you will need to read the "quick start" instructions from the [readme file](./sanuli/README.md) and apply them in your Dockerfile. You will need to utilize the [`WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `EXPOSE` and `CMD` instructions](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/), which are described in every Docker tutorial, and they are typically used very similarly regardless of the technology being used. Copying source code into the image, installing dependencies and building applications is very similar regardless of whether you are using Rust, Node.js, React, Java or any other technology.

We recommend referring to the [Dockerfile reference documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) for a detailed explanation of each instruction. Consider when each instruction should be executed. For example, installing tools and dependencies should happen in the build phase using `RUN` instructions, while starting the development server should be done in the run phase using `CMD` (or `ENTRYPOINT`) instructions.


### Accepting connections from the host system

When running a web application in a Docker container, you need to ensure that the application is accessible from your host system. By default, the `trunk` development server listens only to the localhost interface, which means that the app won't accept connections from the host system, but only from the container itself.

To allow connections from the host system (your browser), you need to [specify the `--address` option when running the `trunk serve` command](https://trunkrs.dev/configuration/#server-section) in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# listens to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
CMD ["trunk", "serve", "--address", "0.0.0.0"]
```


### Adding word lists

Sanuli uses a few word lists to provide words for the game, which are referred to in the [Sanuli readme file](./sanuli/README.md). The word lists are not included in the repository, so you will need to prepare them yourself. For this exercise, the contents of the word lists are not important, so you can create empty files or write a few five letter words in text files yourself. You can also familiarize yourself with the scripts in [sanuli/src/bin](./sanuli/src/bin/) folder.

If you want, you can use the word lists provided by the [Institute for the Languages of Finland](https://kotus.fi/) (Kotimaisten kielten keskus). Their [Nykysuomen sanalista](https://kotus.fi/sanakirjat/kielitoimiston-sanakirja/nykysuomen-sana-aineistot/nykysuomen-sanalista/) can be downloaded and used according to the [license terms](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.fi).

We have prepared a [fetch-words.sh](./fetch-words.sh) script that will download the word list from the Kotus website and prepare it in a format that Sanuli can use. You can *copy the script into the container* and *run it there during the build*, before the build steps for the application itself is built.

Please note that the URL and the format of the word list is subject to change, so familiarize yourself with the script and the Kotus website to make sure everything works as expected:

> *"The list is updated in connection with updates to the Kielitoimisto dictionary, approximately every year or two, and other changes may also be made."*

## Step 2: Building the Docker image

Once you have either completed or at least added a few first lines to the Dockerfile, you can build the Docker image. To do this, run the following command in the terminal from the root of your repository:

```bash
# run build in current folder "." and tag the image as "sanuli"
docker build --tag sanuli .
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you install the dependencies in the build phase, it can take a very long time. However, [Docker caches the layers of the image](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/), so subsequent builds will be faster. It is a good practice to organize the instructions in the Dockerfile so that the layers that change less frequently or are slower to execute are placed earlier in the file.


## Step 3: Running the containerized application

Once the image is built, you can run the application in a container. As the app is a web application, you will need to expose the port on which the application is running. By default, Sanuli runs on port 8080, so you will need to map that port to a port on your host system. To do this, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# Run the container and map port 8080 in the container to port 8080 on the host.
# `--rm` option removes the container automatically after it is stopped.
docker run --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 sanuli
```

When the container is running, you can access the application in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the Sanuli game interface. If the connection is refused but there are no erros in the Docker logs, verify that you specified the server to listen to all interfaces by using the `--address` option in the `CMD` instruction of your Dockerfile, as described earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting the application is likely produce a few warnings related to unused variables or unexpected conditions. These warnings are not errors, and they do not prevent the application from running.

If you get an error message about the port being in use, make sure that you have not already started an application on that port and that another Sanuli container is not already running in the background. You can check the running containers with the command `docker container ls` or `docker ps` and stop them with `docker container stop <container_id>`, if necessary.


## Step 4: Ignoring files with `.dockerignore`

The container seems to be running nicely, but there are some files in there that we would not like to copy into the container. Typically such files include local build artifacts or *node_modules* that are not needed in the container, or *.env* files, which contain your local environment variables. In Sanuli's case, we would like to exclude the *README.md* file from the container.

Your task is to create a `.dockerignore` file to specify which files and directories should be ignored when building the Docker image. Add a new `.dockerignore` file alongside your Dockerfile and add specify the `README.md` file under [sanuli/](./sanuli/) folder in it. Then add and commit your changes to the repository.

> [!NOTE]
> As the *README.md* file is in the subfolder, you can't just write the name `README.md` in the `.dockerignore` file. There are many ways you can refer to the file, either with a specific path or a pattern. See the [Docker documentation on .dockerignore files](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#dockerignore-files) for options on how to exclude that file.


## Step 5: multi stage Dockerfile

As you have noticed at this point, building the Sanuli application requires quite a bunch of tools and dependencies and it can be slow. Use `docker image ls` to list the images on your system and see how large the Sanuli image is before any optimizations. The size of the image is expected to be over 2 gigabytes, which is quite large for this relatively simple web application.

To this point, we have been utilizing Rust development tools and the Trunk development server, but in production, none of these tools will be required. When publishing the app, only the compiled source code and static files (word lists, images etc.) are needed. All of these can be served to the clients as static files. The size of our production image should therefore be measured in megabytes, not gigabytes. To reduce the size, we can use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) in the Dockerfile.

Familiarize yourself with multi-stage builds using [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=docker+multi+stage+build), [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=docker+multi+stage+build) and [articles](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-react-app/) of your choice. Then, refer to the Sanuli readme section for "Release build", which explains the single command, that produces a small production package of the application.

When you have a rough understanding of the concept, you can start modifying your Dockerfile. The following example shows how to structure the Dockerfile using multi-stage builds.

The example below is almost complete, and it does not require many changes. We recommend you use it as the starting point. The first stages, `builder-base` and `dev`, are the ones that correspond to the previous parts of the exercise. `build` is a new stage, where the production artifacts are built, and `release` is the final stage that serves the built application using an nginx web server.

You will only need to make changes in the `builder-base` and `dev` stages, which the `build` and `release` stages depend on. If you have a workig Dockerfile from the previous steps, you will only need to move the existing instructions to the correct stages to complete this final modification to the Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM rust:latest AS builder-base
# This base step should have the instructions that are required by other stages,
# such as installing dependencies.
#
# Move your previous COPY, RUN and WORKDIR instructions here, so they are completed
# before the next stages. If the WORKDIR is set to something other than `/sanuli`,
# make sure to update the COPY instruction in the release stage below to match.
#
# You can leave out the CMD instruction, as this stage is not meant to produce a
# runnable application, but to prepare a reusable environment.



FROM builder-base AS dev
# This stage is used for development, and it uses the previous builder-base as its
# base, so the code and dependencies are already in place. In here, add the
# EXPOSE and CMD instructions from your initial solution to expose the port
# and to start the development server.



FROM builder-base AS build
# In this stage, we will build the production artifacts. The stage uses the
# same base as the dev stage, so the environment should be ready. You should
# not need to modify this stage, as we already added the build command from
# the Sanuli readme file:
#
ENV RUSTFLAGS="--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis --remap-path-prefix \$HOME=~"
RUN trunk build --release
#
# No CMD instruction is needed here, as there is no need to run a container
# from this stage. Instead, we will copy and serve the built artifacts at
# /sanuli/dist in the next stage.



FROM nginx:alpine AS release
# This is the final stage, which uses the nginx base image to serve the built app.
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx for information about the nginx base image.
# You should not need to modify this stage.
#
# Note that this stage is not based on the previous stages, which produced very
# large images containing the Rust toolchain and development server. Instead, it
# is based on a lightweight nginx image, which has nothing to do with Rust or
# the previous development tools. This is the key to reducing the size of the
# final image to just megabytes.
#
# Copy the static files from the `build` stage to the public directory of nginx:
COPY --from=build /sanuli/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
#
# Nginx listens to port 80 by default, so we expose that port:
EXPOSE 80
#
# A CMD instruction is not needed here, as the nginx base image already has a CMD,
# which will be inherited. The nginx server will start when this container is run.
```

After these changes, you can build different images for development and production purposes. The development image will contain the Rust toolchain and the development server, while the production image will only contain the built static files and an nginx web server to serve them to clients.


## Step 6: Building and running the multi-stage Dockerfile

From now on, you can specify which stage you want to build by using the `--target` option in the `docker build` command. For example, to build the stage named as `dev` in the Dockerfile, you can run:

```bash
# build the `dev` stage as target and tag the image as sanuli-dev:
docker build --target dev --tag sanuli-dev .

# run the development image in a container like before:
docker run --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 sanuli-dev

# then, visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

To build the production image, set the target to `release`, as specified in the last stage in the Dockerfile:

```bash
# build the `release` stage and tag it as sanuli:
docker build --target release --tag sanuli .

# now, run the production image, but map the local port to port 80 in the container:
docker run --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:80:80 sanuli

# then, visit http://localhost in your browser
```

The production image should now start in an instant and nginx should start several processes to serve the files efficiently to a large number of users. Verify that the application is running by visiting [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your web browser.

Last, check the sizes of your images using the `docker image ls` command. The development image should still be very large, while the production image should be much smaller, measured in megabytes.

```bash
docker image ls
```


## Submitting your work

Add, commit and push your solutions to your repository to invoke the automated grading. You can and should commit your solutions after each step to keep track of your progress and to make it easier to debug any issues that may arise. The automated grading will check your solutions and provide feedback on your progress.

Automated grading is implemented using GitHub actions and GitHub classroom. After each commit, you can see the autograding results as well as each test and their outputs in the *actions* tab under *Classroom Autograding Workflow*. You can push new solutions as many times as necessary until the deadline of the exercise.


## Optional: remove the container(s) and image(s)

Although Sanuli is a simple web app, its container can be 2 gigabytes in size, so it is a good idea to remove the container and image after you have completed the exercise. This will free up disk space on your system.

Use the commands `docker container ls --all` and `docker image ls` to list all containers and images that you have used in this exercise. You will need to stop and remove containers before you can remove the images. To remove a container, use the `docker container rm` command, and to remove an image, use the `docker image rm` command.
